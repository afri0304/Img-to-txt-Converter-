A free online Optical Character Recognition software translates the characters in a picture into electronically designated characters. This can translate any sort of text on photo and you can use it as an image to word converter online to conveniently extract text on any image, straight from the photo itself rather than going through all the trouble of typing. This online image to text is a handy service which enables you to upload any image file, analyze the text in it and then convert the typed, printed or handwritten text in the image into the text file that you can easily share, download or edit on your computer.
